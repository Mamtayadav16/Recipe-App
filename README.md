# Recipe-App  
Itâ€™s a simple recipe search app, that uses Spoonacular API to search the recipe,
Using this app user can search the recipe based on their choice. They can search the recipe by their name, by the ingredient's name, or even by uploading the image of the ingredient. 
In the project, I have implemented various Android concepts like using card view, linear layout, search view, and recycler view. 
I have used retrofit for uploading data from API that was in JSON format.
Picasso for loading the image from API.
Also, I have used TensorFlow for image recognition for ingredients. The model will recognize the image and based on that it will show the recipe.
